    "1. Code reusability\n",
    "2. Write once and run anytime\n",
    "3. It must return value'\n",
    "4. Instead of writing same code many time we need to call the function to accomplish the task for you.\n",
    "5. When writing a number of statement inside a block and whcih can be executed in a sequential manner then that single unit is\n",
    "called as function.\n",
    "\n",
    "#2. When does the code in a function run: when it's specified or when it's called?\n",
    "\n",
